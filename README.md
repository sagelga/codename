# Codename
Codenames word list repository for all.

Codenames is a board game created by Vlaada Chv√°til and published by Czech Games Edition. 
This repository is created to store all of the words that are in the board game (and custom too!) words for your recreational and non-commercial use.

Noted that I did not own and create a certain wordlist. They are all scrapped from the Internet or contributed by GitHub user, then get checked and cleaned by me [@sagelga](https://github.com/sagelga).
